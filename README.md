# Interactive Selection Boxes

This project provides an interactive UI for selecting product options such as size and color. Clicking on a selection box expands additional options, and selecting another box automatically collapses the previously expanded one.

## Features
- Expandable selection boxes
- Auto-collapse of other boxes when a new one is clicked
- Smooth transitions for an enhanced user experience
- Simple and clean design with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure the interactive selection boxes.
- **CSS**: Styling and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Handling click events and toggle behavior.

## How It Works
1. Each selection box represents a product option (e.g., 2 Pair, 3 Pair, 4 Pair).
2. Clicking a selection box expands the option list.
3. Clicking another selection box automatically collapses the previous one.
4. Users can choose size and color for each item within the expanded box.

   git clone <repo-url>
